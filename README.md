# protorand

`protorand` generates a Protobuf message struct with random values from any type implementing the `proto.Message` interface.
 `proto.Message` is implemented by all structs generated by the default complier for Protocol Buffers.
It also recursibely embeds values to struct fields in a struct and supports Map, Slice (`repeated` in Protobuf) and OneOf.

## What is this for?

You can generate proto messages filled with random values.
You can use it for some testing purposes like random value test or performance test.

## Install 🚀

```
$ go get -u github.com/sryoya/protorand
```

## Example

```.go
pr := protorand.New()
pb := &testpb.TestMessage{} // some protobuf message struct
res, err := pr.Gen(pb) 
if err != nil {
    // some error handling
}
fmt.Println(res) // now it prints the protobuf message struct with random values
```

## To Be Developped 🏭

This package is under the development. The unimplemented features that would be implemented are follwing:

- Handling for [known types](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf) like `TimeStamp`
- Randomize the number of elements in `List` and `Map` (Currently, it always sets just one element)
- `Optional` field
